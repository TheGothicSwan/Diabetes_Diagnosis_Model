The Diabetes Diagnosis Model Web App is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on various health parameters.

The model uses historical health data and employs algorithms to classify individuals as either at risk(Diabetic) or not at risk (Not Diabetic)

OBJECTIVES
1. To develop a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of diabetes.
2. To analyse the impact of different health parameters on diabetes risk.
3. To provide insights and recommendations for prevention strategies

FEATURES
1. Data Collection: Dataset utilized contained health metrics such as Age, blood pressure, BMI, Glucose levels, Insulin levels, Skin Thickness, Diabetes pedigree Function etc.
2. Machine Learning Algorithm: i Implemented using the SVM(Support Vector Machine) and achieved an accuracy of 77%

FUTURE WORK
1. Explore more algorithms to improve prediction accuracy
2. Incorporate more diverse datasets for better generalization.
